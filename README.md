# Serve Content Files Plugin for PhileCMS #

This plugin tries some magicâ„¢ to directly serve additional files from the `content/` directory:

- change HTML output and insert `content/` if it's missing in URLs
- serve requests without `content/` in URL from the `content/` directory

Note: This plugin trades some performance (potentially serving files through PHP) for convenience (no need to fiddle with the server or content files).
